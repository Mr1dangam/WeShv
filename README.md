## Tackling Food Insecurity and Waste through a Seamless Food Redistribution Platform

WeShv follows a very unique structure in order to solve the problem of the food crisis and food waste. It works on a node-based system with 5 elements that create a comprehensive ecosystem and a user-driven community focused on food donation and saving. The five elements are Donors, NGOs, Hosts, Volunteers, and Pickers. We have a Geographical Map-Based hotspot system with pins allocated to all important places.
